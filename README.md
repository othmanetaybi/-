# -Hangman Game
Hangman is a simple but engaging game that helps improve vocabulary and word recognition. I developed it with HTML CSS JS

Hangman is a classic word guessing game. The goal of the game is for one player to choose a word and the other player to guess it by suggesting letters one by one. The twist is that for every incorrect guess, part of a stick figure is drawn, often representing a person being hanged. The game continues until the guessing player successfully identifies the word or the entire stick figure is drawn, resulting in a loss.
