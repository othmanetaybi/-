# -Hangman Game
Hangman is a simple but engaging game that helps improve vocabulary and word recognition. I developed it with HTML CSS JS

Hangman is a classic word guessing game. The goal of the game is for one player to choose a word and the other player to guess it by suggesting letters one by one. The twist is that for every incorrect guess, part of a stick figure is drawn, often representing a person being hanged. The game continues until the guessing player successfully identifies the word or the entire stick figure is drawn, resulting in a loss.

Winning and Losing:

* The game continues until the guesser correctly identifies the word by filling in all the blanks.
* If the hangman figure is fully drawn before the word is guessed, the game is lost.


Hangman is a simple yet engaging game that helps improve vocabulary and word recognition.
